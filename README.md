#Assumptions:
* You have a third party API that is returning some well-formatted JSON data (attached to the task).
* * Goal:
* Using only HTML, JavaScript and CSS generate a visual table report that contains the data returned from the 3rd party service.

#Requirements:
* The report should look the same in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Firefox. Consider some of the latest versions.
The report should contain the following tables:
A basic table that lists each record in the returned data as a separate row. The columns will be the record properties. The last row should be a summary row containing an aggregated (summary) column data (where possible).
Customizable table that support 2 axis (vertical and horizontal) and grouping by those axis. Those 2 axis can be configured from 2 combo boxes on top of the table and will contain the properties of the records in the returned data, i.e. name, class, markâ€¦
Make those tables user-friendly and interactive as you can.
